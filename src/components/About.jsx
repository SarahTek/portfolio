        <p className='text-xl mt-10'>Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is Sarah Teklemariam and I am a Frontend developer. I have a diverse background, having worked as a nurse assistant and in customer service for over 10 years. I also have a Bachelors in Business Management. Despite my non-technical background, I discovered a passion for coding when I first learned HTML and CSS in 2021. Since then, I have dedicated myself to improving my skills and have even joined Code Fellows to further my education. </p>
        <br />

        <p className='text-xl'>
          In addition to my technical skills, I also have experience working with people and am proficient in English as a second language. I am seeking a job as a Frontend Developer and believe that my diverse background, dedication to learning, and problem-solving abilities make me a strong candidate for any team.
